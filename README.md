This repository is a collection of projects and resources for exploring various machine learning algorithms. Here, you'll find code implementations, data files, and potentially analysis notebooks for projects covering tasks like:

Regression: Predicting continuous target variables
Classification algorithms: Categorizing data points into predefined classes 
Clustering algorithms: Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes 
This repository is a provide a central location for my experimentations and learning with different machine learning techniques.
