This repository is a treasure trove of projects exploring various machine learning algorithms! Here, you'll find code, data, and potentially analysis notebooks for projects utilizing a diverse set of techniques, including:

Naive Bayes: Classifies data points based on conditional probabilities.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Identifies a class based on the majority vote of its closest neighbors.

Decision Trees: Makes predictions by following a tree-like structure based on a series of features.

Random Forest: Combines multiple decision trees for improved accuracy and robustness.

Support Vector Machines (SVM): Creates a hyperplane to separate data points into distinct classes.

Logistic Regression: Models the relationship between features and a binary target variable.

This repository is your launchpad for delving into the world of machine learning and experimenting with these powerful algorithms..
